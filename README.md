AdvancedCalculator
==================
written in Java

This is my calculator.
Currently it allows the user to perform basic operations, sin, cos, tan and parenthesis.
I plan on adding a menu bar or button that will allow the user to change between radians and degrees, the level of precision and more things I can't think of at the moment.
Also eventually I will make the GUI more aesthetically pleasing.
